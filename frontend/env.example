# Moonshine speech recognition model - sets the default model for the app
# Options: model/tiny (~190MB, fast), model/base (~400MB, accurate), model/small (~300MB, balanced)
#
# Default is model/base for better speech-to-text accuracy, which improves lexical detection.
# This value becomes the default in the model selector dropdown (dev mode only).
#
# IMPORTANT: If you change this, update the same variable in e2e/env.example to keep tests in sync.
# Both files now use VITE_MOONSHINE_MODEL with the 'model/' prefix format.
#
# See frontend/docs/MOONSHINE_MODELS.md for detailed model comparison.
