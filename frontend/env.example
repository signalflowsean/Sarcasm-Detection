# Moonshine speech recognition model - sets the default model for the app
# Options: model/tiny (~190MB, fast), model/base (~400MB, accurate)
#
# Default is model/base for better speech-to-text accuracy, which improves lexical detection.
# This value becomes the default in the model selector dropdown (dev mode only).
#
# IMPORTANT: If you change this, update the same variable in e2e/env.example to keep tests in sync.
# Both files now use VITE_MOONSHINE_MODEL with the 'model/' prefix format.
#
# See frontend/docs/MOONSHINE_MODELS.md for detailed model comparison.

VITE_MOONSHINE_MODEL=model/base

# Moonshine timeout configuration (in milliseconds)
#
# VITE_MOONSHINE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS: Maximum time to wait for model download and initialization
# Default: 1800000 (30 minutes). Adjust based on your connection speed:
#   - Fast (50+ Mbps): ~1 minute download time
#   - Average (10 Mbps): ~5 minutes download time
#   - Slow (2 Mbps): ~27 minutes download time (400MB model)
#
# VITE_MOONSHINE_VAD_TIMEOUT_MS: Maximum time to wait for VAD (Voice Activity Detection) initialization
# Default: 10000 (10 seconds). This is a fallback when there's silence during initialization.
#
# Examples for different connection speeds:
# Fast connection (reduce timeout):
# VITE_MOONSHINE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS=300000   # 5 minutes
#
# Very slow connection (increase timeout):
# VITE_MOONSHINE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS=2700000  # 45 minutes
#
# Adjust VAD timeout if needed:
# VITE_MOONSHINE_VAD_TIMEOUT_MS=15000      # 15 seconds
